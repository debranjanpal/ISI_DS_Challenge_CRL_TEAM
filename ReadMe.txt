Introduction:
A project for predicting the class of symmetric-key block based ciphers with machine learning. This is a distinguishing attack and posed as a multi-class classification (supervised learning) problem. A large set of plaintexts is taken from a benchmark dataset. These plaintexts are converted into ciphertexts and cropped to the same length. There are three columns in the dataset. The first column denotes the ID of the ciphertext. The second column comprises either the ciphertexts generated by applying some ciphers or random text. The ciphertexts/random texts are given in hexadecimal representation. Each ciphertext/random text has a length of 2000 hexadecimal characters. The third column consists of the labels (0, 1, 2 and 3), which denote the ciphertext type. The dataset is segregated into two parts - training and test. The training dataset comprises 80,000 ciphertexts. The training dataset includes the labels. The test dataset comprises 20,000 ciphertexts without any labels. The labels of the test dataset are to be predicted. The submitted trained models will be applied on the test dataset by the organizers. The performance metric for the multi-class classification on the test dataset will be the accuracy score.
